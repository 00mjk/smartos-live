This is just a convenient temporary TODO list...

 - derive bootfile etc.from "platform-version" ?
 - scripts/joysetup.sh
 - need RICHMOND-16 testing
 - Triton doc changes
 - test reflash
 - Need to update or get rid of sdc-booter/tools/update_ipxe?
 - sdc-booter menu.lst code??
 - sdcadm platform is still grub specific (hnPlatform / TOOLS-1000)
 - ipxe boot: "boot_archive.hash will not be loaded"
 - triton/repos.json: sdcboot still mentioned
 - update sdcboot to show it's not used

Later

 - sdc-usbkey
   - add subcommand to dump boot component version JSON blob
 - need to run loader install for headnode not just CNs
 - would be nice if autoboot showed what it was going boot
 - would be nice to show the default console device again
 - usb key conversion tool
 - replace screen-rows/cols name with ncols name? avoid problems?
 - Add Joyent/SmartOS image/branding for VGA console?
