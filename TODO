This is just a convenient temporary TODO list...

 - need RICHMOND-16 handling
 - do we need the 8Gb image? If so, what S/W uses it upstream
   that may need fixing? check into sdc-headnode makefiles for picking
   an image? Maybe remove?
 - COAL doesn't auto-boot?
 - sdcboot image needs versioning for freedos, ipxe, memtest version,
   loader
 - upstream multi-console fix for loader
 - encode joyent boot image version into MBR
   - update tools/lib/usbkey.js and lib/sdc/usb-key.sh to consume it
 - usb key conversion tool
 - ipxe
   - build triton/coal image with updated ipxe
   - make PXE boot menu entry in loader actually work
 - Add option in Loader menu to toggle DR
 - Triton Doc changes
 - Get "sdcadm platform" working with Loader
 - Get sdc-setconsole working with Loader
 - bin/reflash
 - sdc-usbkey
   - add subcommand to dump boot component version JSON blob
 - resync with loader gate
 - /etc/release style file in usb key
 - replace screen-rows/cols name with ncols name? avoid problems?
