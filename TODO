This is just a convenient temporary TODO list...

 - need RICHMOND-16 handling
 - do we need the 8Gb image? If so, what S/W uses it upstream
   that may need fixing?
 - COAL doesn't auto-boot?
 - 4GB usb image has noise about disk read failures
 - upstream multi-console fix for loader
 - can we version via the MBR? And fix tools to look there?
 - usb key conversion tool
 - ipxe
 - doc changes
 - scripts/mount-usb.sh
 - tools/lib/usbkey.js
 - sdcadm platform
 - bin/reflash
 - sdc-usbkey
 - replace screen-rows/cols name with ncols name? avoid problems?
 - fix sdc-headnode to use tmpfs again not /var/tmp
 - sdc-headnode: tools/bin/sdc-setconsole
 - scripts/joysetup.sh
