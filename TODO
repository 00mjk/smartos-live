This is just a convenient temporary TODO list...

 - scripts/joysetup.sh
 - Triton doc changes
 - can we remove TOOLS-1000 changes?
 - archive sdcboot on git hub
 - sync ipxe into kvm-cmd
 - should we bzip usb image?
 - update copyrights?

Repos with changes
------------------

	illumos-joyent
	smartos-live
	sdc-headnode
	mountain-gorilla
	triton
	sdcboot
	sdc-booter
	ipxe
	kvm-cmd?

Later

 - sdc-usbkey
   - add subcommand to dump boot component version JSON blob
 - need to run loader install for headnode not just CNs
 - would be nice if autoboot showed what it was going boot
 - would be nice to show the default console device again
 - usb key conversion tool
 - replace screen-rows/cols name with ncols name? avoid problems?
 - Add Joyent/SmartOS image/branding for VGA console?
