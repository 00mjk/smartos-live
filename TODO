This is just a convenient temporary TODO list...

 - scripts/joysetup.sh
 - Triton doc changes
 - sdc-booter: need EFI ipxe support?
 - can we remove TOOLS-1000 changes?
 - ipxe boot: "boot_archive.hash will not be loaded"
 - archive sdcboot on git hub
 - ipxe multiboot support
 - sync ipxe into kvm-cmd

 - need to run loader install for headnode not just CNs
 - would be nice if autoboot showed what it was going boot
 - would be nice to show the default console device again
 - usb key conversion tool
 - replace screen-rows/cols name with ncols name? avoid problems?
 - Add Joyent/SmartOS image/branding for VGA console?
