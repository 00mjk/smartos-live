This is just a convenient temporary TODO list...

 - need RICHMOND-16 testing
 - Triton doc changes
 - sdcboot image needs versioning for ipxe, loader, sdc-headnode tools?
 - test reflash
 - Need to update or get rid of sdc-booter/tools/update_ipxe?
 - sdc-booter menu.lst code??
 - sdcadm platform is still grub specific
 - last bits of mount-usb.sh users (sdc-headnode, sdcadm); should we deliver a "don't use this"
   placeholder?
 - replace screen-rows/cols name with ncols name? avoid problems?
 - ipxe boot: "boot_archive.hash will not be loaded"
 - Add Joyent/SmartOS image/branding for VGA console?
 - smartdc-init:update_local_key - can we kill 6.5 upgrade?
 - triton/repos.json: sdcboot still mentioned
 - what else to do to retire sdcboot? archive?

Later

 - sdc-usbkey
   - add subcommand to dump boot component version JSON blob
 - need to run loader install for headnode not just CNs
 - would be nice if autoboot showed what it was going boot
 - would be nice to show the default console device again
 - usb key conversion tool
