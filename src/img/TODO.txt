- imgadm2 publish SNAPSHOT (or some other name) to zfs send a prepared
  snapshot and manifest info to IMGAPI. This is for customer image
  creation. This then needs to take auth info optionally? Check with /ping
  if need to auth.

# someday/maybe

- pimped out logging a la vmadm
- switch to optimist or better option processing

  I hate nopt's decision to allow "imgadm -v|--ve|--ver|...|--version"
- separate node-cmdln
- HTTP caching when talking to sources.

# compatibility docs

COMPATIBILITY section in man page.

- 'imgadm show UUID' no longer includes the non-IMGAPI "_url" field. The
  equivalent data is now in the "source" field of 'imgadm info UUID'.
- 'imgadm update' differences
- /var/db/imgadm -> /var/imgadm   Though this is internal details.
- /var/db/imgadm/sources.list -> `imgadm sources ...`
- 'imgadm info UUID' changes: dropped the 'children' and 'volume' keys. They
  were undocumented/unspecified. Added the 'source'.
